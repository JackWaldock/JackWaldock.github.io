Calls in between VoIP and the analogue network are enabled by devices (such as Media Gateways) creating connections between them.</p>

Keep reading to learn more about the VoIP services and features of each provider, and which businesses they are best matched to. A PBX essentially allows team members to share inbound calls and also use the exact same outbound contact number regardless of the number of individuals are on the phone.</p>
