<p>Database Systems Corp Nevertheless, today the variety of office phone systems for small business is huge and are based on various technology platforms. More than a third of services now use VoIP as their go-to system. A hosted system supplies all PBX applications, functions and services, and it keeps software application in the cloud instead of on a server like digital systems. By bringing motion pictures, tv, video brochures, remote CD-ROMs, corporate LANs and the Internet into homes and small companies, DSL could make these markets practical for telephone companies and application providers alike.</p>
<p>Multi-line telephone systems, consisting of 2-line business phone systems and 4-line phone systems, are developed to permit multiple individuals to be on the phone at the same time. In essence, phone calls are sent from the sender to the recipient through the internet. VoIP can also piggyback off your existing internet service to link directly to your business's PBX (personal branch exchange, or closed office telephone network), removing the requirement for a different line and most, if not all, tradition phone devices.</p>
<p>A number of networking elements are needed to make VoIP phones work. Save a lot-- We usually save organisations about 50% off their phone bill and up to 90% off what it would cost them to invest in a conventional PBX system. Most hosted PBX providers do not require clients to buy any devices beyond IP phones. In addition, new companies - especially smaller-sized start-up companies - tend to opt for VoIP for their professional interactions needs.</p>
