However, if your business should comply with security policies that need data to be saved on-site, then a hosted service is probably not the very best solution. The only difference in between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower expense these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the traditional phone lines) rather of the Internet (as is the case with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
